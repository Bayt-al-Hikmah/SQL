# SQL Introduction Course

Welcome to the **SQL Introduction Course** repository by Bayt-al-Hikmah! This collection of lecture notes is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master SQL fundamentals using SQLite. Whether you're new to databases or refreshing your skills, these notes provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core concepts.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in SQL.

## Prerequisites
